This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue is that `AsyncStorage.getItem` returns a Promise that resolves to a string, even if you've stored a JSON object. Attempting to directly access properties of this string (e.g., `storedData.property`) will throw an error because you're trying to access properties of a string, not an object.

**Problematic Code:**
```javascript
AsyncStorage.getItem('myData').then((data) => {
  console.log(data.someProperty); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
});
```
